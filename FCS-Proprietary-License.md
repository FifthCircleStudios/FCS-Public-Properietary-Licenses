"Proprietary Code" means any Code developed by Fifth Circle Studios that is not open source and is subject to the terms of this License.
"Public Code" refers to any Code that is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) or similar open-source licenses, which may be used in conjunction with Proprietary Code.
"Confidential Portions" are parts of the Code that are intentionally obscured or omitted when paired with open-source components, to protect proprietary aspects of Fifth Circle's software.
